  <h1>Voyager 1</h1>
  <p>
    Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA in 1977 to study the outer solar system and beyond. It is one of the most distant man-made objects from Earth, currently located over 14 billion miles (22.5 billion kilometers) away from us.

    Voyager 1 is still transmitting data back to Earth, even though it was launched more than 40 years ago. The data it has sent back has provided important insights into the outer solar system, including the discovery of active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io, the first detailed images of Saturn's rings, and the detection of a previously unknown ring around Uranus.
    
    Voyager 1 also carries a special message for any extraterrestrial life forms that may encounter it in the future, in the form of a golden record containing sounds and images that represent the diversity of life and culture on Earth.
